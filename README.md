# testrepo
This is my test repo for all my SMU Homework Assignments. 

So far it contains a folder for my Doing Data Science class: MSDS6306. 
Within the folder, it contains my data science profile, datasets from assignments, and actual R markdowns. 

If you have any questions, my contact information for coursework is: ssprague@smu.edu

Enjoy!
